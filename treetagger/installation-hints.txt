The following installation hints were kindly provided by Joachim
Wagner and his colleagues from Dublin City University.

1. All downloads must be saved under the name proposed (=given in the
   hyper-link) and in one directory. If your system automatically
   uncompresses the files, find another method to save them, for
   example right-click or use a different browser. The installation
   script won't be able to process the files otherwise.

2. If 'sh install-tagger.sh' aborts abnormally and the script is 5273
   bytes long instead of 5075 bytes, convert linebreaks to Unix
   standard, for example: tr -d $'\r' <install-tagger.sh >install2.sh
   and give it a try with the new file (sh install2.sh).

3. If the test aborts with a message about missing gawk or perl
   interpreter, use the commands "which perl", "which gawk" and "which
   awk" to find out where they are and edit the file in which the
   error occurs. For example, I had to change gawk to awk in line 6 of
   filter-german-tags and to delete local/ from line 1 of
   filter-chunker-output.perl.
